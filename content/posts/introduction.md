This is a personal project to make an effort to protect my home network. I hope you find it helpful in securing your own.

I'm starting from a place of having some equipment in my house. Fiberoptic internet coming in, converter, Araknis router, two luxul switches.  Have a couple of WAPs.

In my house there are a lot of devices:
- Personal Laptop
- Testing Laptop
- Personal Desktop
- Work Laptop
- Ipad 1
- Ipad 2
- Sonos 1
- Sonos 2
- Google Home
- Kid 1 Laptop 1
- Kid 1 Laptop 2
- Kid 1 Workstation
- Kid 2 Laptop 1
- Kid 2 Laptop 2
- iPhone 1
- iPhone 2
- iPhone 3
- Panasonic TV
- HP Printer

What I want to do is a couple of things.
1) Lockdown access to the devices in my home from the outside
2) Lockdown my wifi so it doesn't broadcast itself to the neighborhood
3) Lockdown access to my routers from the folks who installed them
4) Lockdown ports / what is needed on the various devices
5) Setup logs for the various devices in my network and have them flow into some sort of SIEM.  
6) Setup some kind of alarming for suspicious activity.
